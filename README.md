# Movie Reccomendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie descriptions.

# Key Features

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes NLP techniques to analyze and understand movie descriptions and user preferences. NLTK Integration: Leverages the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing and linguistic analysis. Count Vectorizer: Employs CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors, enabling the calculation of similarities between movies.

# How It Works

Data Collection: Collects movie data, including titles, descriptions, and genres. Text Processing: Uses NLTK to preprocess text data, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization. Feature Extraction: Applies CountVectorizer to convert text data into feature vectors for each movie. Similarity Calculation: Computes similarity scores between movies based on their feature vectors to generate recommendations. Recommendation Generation: Provides a list of recommended movies based on user input and similarity scores.
